In Apache Spark, you can indeed have only one active SparkSession per JVM, and it will have its own SparkContext associated with it. The SparkContext manages the execution of Spark jobs within a Spark application.

Regarding connecting to multiple S3 buckets with different AWS access keys within the same Spark application, it's important to note that you cannot directly set different AWS access keys per connection or per bucket within the same Spark application. Once you set the AWS access keys using the Hadoop configuration, they will be used by all connections made from that process, including any connections created by the SparkContext.

However, you can dynamically change the AWS access keys within the same Spark application by resetting the Hadoop configuration. This allows you to access different S3 buckets with different access keys at different times during the execution of your Spark application.
